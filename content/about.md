## Welcome to my Software Engineering blog!

I am Ostap Mykytiuk and I am an undergraduate student at Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv. My main interests are Rust and C++ languages, compilers, static analysis and 
low-level software optimization.

Here you can find my thoughts and researches on topics I'm interested in.

If you have any questions or want to discuss something reach me out at ostapmk at gmail dot com.
