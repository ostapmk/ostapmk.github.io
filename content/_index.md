## Welcome to my blog!

Hi, I'm Ostap Mykytiuk and I'm an undergraduate student at Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv. My main interests are Rust and C++ languages, compilers, static analysis and low-level software optimization. Here you can find my thoughts on different topics I'm interested in.
